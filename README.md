# Hello and Welcome!

I'm a passionate and curious developer who loves building tools, exploring low-level systems, and contributing to open source. My repositories reflect a range of interests—from compilers and Linux scripting to modern web backends and creative automation.

I enjoy solving hard problems, optimizing performance, and learning new paradigms. I'm currently focused on:

- Full-stack web development
- Tooling, scripting, and automation
- Systems programming (Rust, C, Clojure)
- Game modding and reverse engineering

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open to collaboration or professional opportunities. If something in my repos catches your eye, feel free to open an issue, star a project, or reach out via GitHub discussions.

> Bonus: I’m comfortable working with legacy systems, debugging weird edge cases, and building things from the ground up.

Thanks for stopping by!
